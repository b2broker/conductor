Conductor
===

The main purpose of the service is to be a solution for dynamic allocated 
services, track their uniqueness based not only on `image:tag` but also their 
runtime parameters, and count acquisition references.

Modern orchestration environments offers you management of instances or 
instances-collection, as well as, rules-defined scalability. But in more complex 
scenarios, they suggest you to use API. 

This project aims to solves some issues with service-as-a-resource allocation, 
like those where you need to spawn unique instance (custom configured), and help 
you to dispose those when no subscribers left.

Response
---

It should response to discover particular requested instance or instance set, 
spawn new one, â€” in case once not found, waits for instance's final status, 
report it to requester, track unique, follow the instances changes, count 
subscribers per requested instances and dispose instances which have 0 of them.

### Not responsible for

This project **must not** do, what orchestration platform already do:
- Track failures and force services to recover.
